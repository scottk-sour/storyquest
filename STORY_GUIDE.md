## ✨ Final Notes

This story is a **tool, not a magic solution**. Healing takes time. Some children will connect with it immediately; others may need multiple exposures or may never connect with it - and that's okay.

The most important thing is that **you're trying**. By using therapeutic stories like this, you're showing the child that their feelings matter, their safety matters, and they're not alone.

**Trust the process. Trust the child. Trust yourself.**
