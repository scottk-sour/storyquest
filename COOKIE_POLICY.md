## Child-Friendly Explanation

**What are cookies?**
Cookies are like little notes that help our website remember you. They help us keep you logged in and remember your favorite stories!

**Are cookies safe?**
Yes! Our cookies are safe. We don't use them to spy on you or show you ads. We only use them to make StoryQuest work better for you.

**Can I say no to cookies?**
You can say no to some cookies (like the ones that help us learn which stories are popular), but you need to say yes to the important cookies that keep your account safe and remember your login.

**Do cookies know who I am?**
The important cookies know you're logged in, but the cookies that help us improve StoryQuest don't know your name or anything personal about you. They just count things like "10 children read this story today."
